- [react-router](https://reacttraining.com/react-router/) and [react-router-dom](https://github.com/ReactTraining/react-router/tree/master/packages/react-router-dom): React libraries to deal with application routing, like route changes and navigation;
- [react-js-pagination](https://github.com/vayser/react-js-pagination): React library used to implements paginagion, I've decised to use this lib, because was easier to integrate with my [Table](https://github.com/leandher/rc-makeup-api/blob/master/src/components/Table/Table.js) component then other pagination components and the ui presentation looks like ok;
- [react-select](https://github.com/jedwatson/react-select): React library used on tag filter, great ui presentation and easy usage. I've already used on other project;
- [Recompose](https://github.com/acdlite/recompose): It is a toolkit for creating composable pipelines of higher order components. It allows you to easily separate your logic from your components, creating re-usable building blocks. You can use it to drive your presentational components on any platform React supports.
